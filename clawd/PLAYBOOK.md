# PLAYBOOK.md — Archive Ops System (Logan + Pakistan Office)

This is the execution playbook for Logan's content engine.

Purpose:
- Scale output without chaos
- Keep standards consistent across teams
- Turn managers into multipliers
- Ship content daily, track performance, repeat winners

Everything in this file is written so it can be dropped directly into Discord as SOPs.

## Core Structure (How the Engine Works)

Logan operates a content factory with 3 main layers:

1. **Strategy / Direction (Logan + Managers)**
2. **Production (Creators + Editors)**
3. **Distribution + Account Ops (Posters + Tracking)**

The system is built for volume + repeatable winners, not random creativity.

## Slideshow SOP (Gold Standard)

### Goal
Hook hard in slide 1, retain through slide 5, end with payoff.

3. Curiosity escalation
4. Payoff
5. CTA / close

### QC Checklist

- Story flows fast
- Captions match tone

Editing is not "art." Editing is packaging.

### Rules

- Native TikTok energy

### Winner Cloning
If a format hits:

- Swap intro, angle, clip order
- Keep core structure identical

## Distribution SOP (Posting System)

### Posting Rules
- Never miss scheduled posts
- Accounts should look human
- No spam behavior spikes

### Daily Checklist
- [ ] Posts uploaded
- [ ] Captions correct
- [ ] Logged in tracker
- [ ] No strikes/bans
- [ ] Winners flagged to managers

### Escalation
If banned/flagged:
- Report instantly in #account-issues
- Do not guess fixes
- Manager decides replacement account

---

## QC Scoring Rubric (1–10)

Every piece of content gets a score:

### Hook (1–10)
Does slide/video stop scroll instantly?

### Retention (1–10)
Does it make you want next slide/second?

### Clarity (1–10)
Is the message instantly understandable?

### Native Feel (1–10)
Does it feel original, not repost/slop?

### CTA + Close (1–10)
Does it end with momentum?

Anything under 7 gets revised.

---

## Accountability System (Simple)

Every creator has 3 metrics:
- Output volume
- QC average score
- Winner count per month

Managers are graded on:
- Team output consistency
- QC enforcement
- Winner replication speed

---

## Evidence + Dispute Organization (Court Mode)

When handling serious disputes:

### Folder System
- 01 Contracts
- 02 Text Messages
- 03 Payments
- 04 Proof of Work
- 05 Timeline Summary

### Label Everything
YYYY-MM-DD — Person — Topic — Importance

### Importance Tags
- CRITICAL
- SUPPORTING
- CONTEXT
- BACKUP

Always build an evidence timeline first.
