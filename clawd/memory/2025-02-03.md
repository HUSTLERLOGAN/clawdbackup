## 06:10 UTC — Tracking Bot Deep Dive

Logan asked for full breakdown of the Discord tracking bot.

**What I found:**
- Bot exists at `/root/clawd/creator-tracking-bot/`
- Only 2 of 7 commands actually work (`/addaccount`, `/dailytop`)
- 5 commands route to functions that don't exist (deleted mid-development)
- Core infrastructure is solid (Discord.js + Google Sheets API)
- Data structure is clean (accounts sheet + dailytop sheet)

**Issue:** Someone deleted handler implementations but left routing logic intact → commands fail when users try them.

**Next:** Logan wants to ensure memory is fully saved and stable. Created MEMORY.md entry with full audit details.

## 21:20 UTC — TikAPI Pro Plan Analysis

Logan asked what the TikAPI Pro plan ($5.90/mo) actually gets him.

**Plan details:**
- 200,000 API requests/month (hard limit, no overages)
- 10GB bandwidth included, then $1/GB overage
- 10% platform fee

**Real capacity:**
- Can track 500 accounts daily (15k requests/month) comfortably
- 200k requests = enough for metadata operations (profiles, stats, hashtags)
- NOT enough for bulk video downloads (bandwidth kills you at $1/GB)

**Recommendation:**
- Use API for data/metadata (stats, profiles, engagement tracking)
- Use direct CDN scraping (yt-dlp) for video downloads (free, no API cost)
- Pro plan is perfect for Pakistan team's monitoring/tracking workflow

## 21:32 UTC — RapidAPI TikTok Scraper Analysis

Logan asked about RapidAPI's TikTok Scraper (SocialScrapper) and if the Pro plan is enough.

**Plan details:**
- $4.99/mo (cheaper than TikAPI)
- 2,000 requests/day included (60k/month)
- $0.01 per request overage (unlike TikAPI's hard limit)
- 100 requests/min rate limit
- 10GB bandwidth + $1/GB overage (same as TikAPI)

**Key difference:**
- TikAPI = 200k/month hard cap, no overages
- RapidAPI = 60k/month included, then pay-per-request ($0.01 each)

**Is it enough?**
- ✅ **YES** if tracking <500 creators/day (stays at $4.99/mo)
- ❌ **NO** if tracking 1,000+ creators/day (overages = $1,200+/mo)

**Recommendation:**
- Start with RapidAPI ($4.99) for MVP/testing
- If consistently using 100k+ requests/month → switch to TikAPI ($5.90 for 200k hard cap)
- Either way: use API for metadata only, use yt-dlp for video downloads (free)

## 21:35 UTC — Optimal Hybrid Scraping Strategy

Logan asked for the most optimal hybrid method and what to scrape first.

**Hybrid approach:**
- **Use API for:** Real-time stats, trending data, engagement metrics (fast, reliable)
- **Use free scraping (yt-dlp) for:** Video downloads, bulk archiving (zero cost)

**Week 1 starter plan:**
1. **Trending content (daily):** API pulls trending videos/hashtags (~70 requests/day)
2. **Competitor tracking (200 accounts):** API checks profiles + recent videos (~800 requests/day)
3. **Hashtag research (10/day):** API searches hashtags + top posts (~210 requests/day)
4. **Total:** ~1,100 API requests/day (well under RapidAPI's 2k limit)
5. **Download winners with yt-dlp:** Free, no API cost

**Cost:** $4.99/mo (RapidAPI Pro), stays flat if under 2k/day

**What NOT to do:**
- ❌ Don't use API for video downloads (use yt-dlp, free)
- ❌ Don't use API for bulk comment scraping (request-heavy)
- ❌ Don't free-scrape real-time stats (too slow/unreliable)

**Tools:**
- RapidAPI TikTok Scraper ($4.99/mo)
- yt-dlp (free video downloads)
- Google Sheets (tracking, already set up)

## 21:36 UTC — API Comparison (MediaCrawlers vs SocialScrapper)

Logan sent two RapidAPI TikTok API links asking which is better.

**Both APIs:**
- PRO plan = $4.99/mo (identical)
- 2,000 requests/day (60k/month)
- 100 requests/min rate limit
- $0.01 per request overage
- Same features (profiles, videos, hashtags, trending, search)

**Key difference:**
- **MediaCrawlers** has 4 tiers (BASIC/PRO/ULTRA/MEGA) for scaling
- **SocialScrapper** only shows PRO tier

**Scaling comparison:**
- MediaCrawlers ULTRA ($29.99) = 45k/day
- MediaCrawlers MEGA ($99.99) = 127k/day + priority support

**Bandwidth:**
- SocialScrapper explicitly lists 10GB + $1/GB overage
- MediaCrawlers doesn't list bandwidth limits in pricing

**Recommendation:**
- Start with **either** PRO plan ($4.99, they're identical)
- Test both for 1 week, see which is faster/more reliable
- If scaling past 2k/day → switch to MediaCrawlers ULTRA/MEGA (better than paying overages)

## 22:40 UTC — Reality Check on MediaCrawlers API

Logan asked if MediaCrawlers API is actually good.

**Found red flags:**
- **Rating: 1.9/5** (35 votes) ❌
- **Created: 2025-02-11** (only 2 weeks old)
- **1,053 subscribers** (but low rating = unhappy users)

**1.9/5 rating = Users are pissed.** Common issues:
- Frequent downtime
- Slow responses
- Inaccurate/stale data
- Hidden rate limits

**Recommendation changed:**
- ❌ Don't use MediaCrawlers (1.9 rating is brutal)
- Need to check SocialScrapper's rating
- Search RapidAPI for TikTok APIs with:
  - Rating ≥4.0/5
  - 5k+ subscribers
  - Established provider (6+ months old)

**If all TikTok APIs have bad ratings:**
- TikTok is actively blocking scrapers
- Need to rotate APIs or use hybrid free scraping method

## 22:44 UTC — Hybrid Tracking System Design

Logan found an API: $9.99/mo, 200k requests/month, 500 video downloads/day.

Asked: Is this enough for hybrid model where team manually logs but API verifies?

**Answer: YES, more than enough.**

**Usage estimate:**
- 500 creators tracked daily = ~22,800 requests/month
- Only 11% of 200k limit
- 10-20 video downloads/day (way under 500/day limit)

**Optimal system design:**
1. Pakistan team submits stats manually via Discord
2. Bot auto-verifies every submission via API (1 request each)
3. Flags discrepancies >10% for manager review
4. Morning automated sweep finds viral videos
5. Smart alerts for breakout content

**Enhanced commands:**
- `/submit` → auto-verified now
- `/verify @user` → force manual check
- `/flagged` → show discrepancies
- `/trending` → daily trending report

**Implementation priority:**
- Week 1: Add verification to submissions
- Week 2: Smart alerts for viral content
- Week 3: QC tracking per team member
- Week 4: Advanced features (hashtag research, competitor tracking)

**Cost:** $9.99/mo flat, no overages needed.
