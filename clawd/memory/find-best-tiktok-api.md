## **Step-by-Step Instructions for Logan**

### **1. Go to RapidAPI and Search**
1. Open: https://rapidapi.com/search/tiktok
2. You'll see a list of TikTok APIs

### **2. Sort by Quality**
Look for these sorting options:
- **"Most Popular"** (top right dropdown)
- **"Highest Rated"**
- **"Most Subscribed"**

### **3. Check Each API's Stats**
For each API, look at:
- ⭐ **Rating** (need ≥4.0/5)
- 📊 **Number of reviews** (more = better data)
- 👥 **Subscribers** (5k+ is good)
- 📅 **Last updated** (recently updated = maintained)

### **4. Check Pricing**
Click on each API and go to **Pricing** tab:
- Compare plans (requests/day, rate limits, overage costs)
- Look for **FREEMIUM** plans (free tier to test)

### **5. Test Before Buying**
- Subscribe to **FREE plan** first
- Test the API with a few requests
- Check response times and data quality

## **Testing Checklist**

Once you find a candidate API:

1. **Subscribe to free plan**
2. **Test these endpoints:**
   - Get user profile (check response time)
   - Get video details (verify data accuracy)
   - Get trending content (see if it's actually current)
3. **Check for errors:**
   - Rate limiting behavior
   - Error messages (are they helpful?)
   - Response consistency
4. **Time 10 requests:**
   - Average response time should be <2 seconds
5. **Compare data to TikTok app:**
   - Do follower counts match?
   - Are view counts accurate?
   - Is trending data current?

## **Decision Matrix**

| API Name | Rating | Subscribers | Price (Pro) | Test Result | Pick? |
|----------|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| TikAPI | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? |
| MediaCrawlers | 1.9 | 1,053 | $4.99 | ❌ Bad rating | ❌ NO |
| SocialScrapper | ? | ? | $4.99 | ? | ? |
| DataFanatic | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? |

**Fill this in after checking each API.**

## **If You Can't Find a Good One**

**Plan B: Multi-API Strategy**
1. Subscribe to 2-3 cheap APIs ($5-10/mo each)
2. Rotate between them (when one gets blocked/slow, switch)
3. Use free scraping (yt-dlp) as backup

**Plan C: Build Your Own**
- Use Playwright to scrape TikTok directly
- Rotate proxies
- More work but more reliable long-term

---

## **Quick Answer (If You Want One Now)**

**I'd check these in order:**

1. **TikAPI** (most established)
2. **DataFanatic's TikTok Data API** (reliable provider)
3. **SocialScrapper** (if rating is good)

**Avoid MediaCrawlers** (1.9 rating is unacceptable).
