## **Higher Tier Comparison**

### **MediaCrawlers ULTRA ($29.99/mo):**
- 45,000 requests/day (1.35M/month)
- 150/min rate limit
- $0.005 overage (half the cost of PRO plan)

### **SocialScrapper:**
- No ULTRA tier listed (only PRO plan shown in initial breakdown)
- Would need to check if they offer higher tiers

### **MediaCrawlers MEGA ($99.99/mo):**
- 127,765 requests/day (3.8M/month)
- 300/min rate limit
- $0.001 overage (10x cheaper than PRO plan)

- **MediaCrawlers** = 4 tiers (BASIC/PRO/ULTRA/MEGA)
- **SocialScrapper** = Only PRO tier visible (may have custom plans)

### **2. Bandwidth**
- **SocialScrapper** = Explicit 10GB + overage pricing
- **MediaCrawlers** = Not listed (likely has bandwidth limits but not publicly shown)

### **3. Support**
- **MediaCrawlers MEGA** = Priority support included
- **SocialScrapper** = Telegram support (@socialscrapper)

---

## **Which One is Better?**

### **For Pakistan Team (500 creators/day monitoring):**

**Start with either API's PRO plan ($4.99/mo):**
- Both identical (2k/day, 100/min, $0.01 overage)
- Test both for 1 week and see which has better:
  - Response times
  - Data accuracy
  - Reliability/uptime

**If scaling past 2k/day:**
- **MediaCrawlers ULTRA** ($29.99) = 45k/day (better value than buying overages)
- **MediaCrawlers MEGA** ($99.99) = 127k/day (best for high-volume operations)

---

## **Recommendation**

**Week 1:**  
Start with **either** API's PRO plan ($4.99/mo). They're functionally identical.

**If you need >2k requests/day consistently:**  
Switch to **MediaCrawlers ULTRA** ($29.99/mo for 45k/day) instead of paying overages.

**If you need >45k requests/day:**  
Use **MediaCrawlers MEGA** ($99.99/mo for 127k/day).

**Cost breakdown:**
- 2k/day with overages on PRO = $4.99 + potential $150-1,200/mo in overages
- 45k/day with ULTRA = $29.99/mo flat (no overages if under limit)

**Bottom line:** Same PRO plan, but MediaCrawlers has better scaling options if you grow.
