# MediaCrawlers TikTok API — Reality Check

**Date:** 2025-02-03  
**Logan asked:** Are you sure this one is good?

---

## **What We Know (From API Page)**

### **Stats:**
- **Rating:** 1.9/5 (35 votes) ❌
- **Subscribers:** 1,053
- **Created:** 2025-02-11 (literally 2 weeks old)
- **Updated:** 2025-02-03 (today)

### **Red Flags:**
1. **Low rating (1.9/5)** — That's terrible
2. **Only 35 votes** — Small sample, but still bad
3. **Very new API** (2 weeks old) — No track record
4. **Provider "mediacrawlers"** — Unknown/unproven

---

## **What This Means**

**1.9/5 rating = Users are pissed.**

Typical reasons for low API ratings:
- Frequent downtime
- Slow response times
- Data quality issues (stale/inaccurate data)
- Poor error handling
- Hidden rate limits not in pricing
- Billing issues

---

## **Should You Use It?**

### **❌ I'd avoid MediaCrawlers**

**Why:**
- 1.9/5 rating is brutal
- Brand new (2 weeks old = no reliability track record)
- 1,053 subscribers doesn't mean they're happy subscribers

---

## **What About SocialScrapper?**

Let me check their stats:
- **Need to verify rating/reviews**
- **Check subscriber count**
- **Look at provider history**

If SocialScrapper also has shit ratings, neither are good.

## **Better Alternatives on RapidAPI**

Instead of guessing, here's what to check:

### **1. TikAPI (Original)**
- URL: https://rapidapi.com/tiktok-api-tiktok-api-default/api/tiktok-api
- Usually has better ratings/reviews
- More established provider

### **2. Search RapidAPI for "TikTok" APIs with:**
- Rating >4.0/5
- 5,000+ subscribers
- Established provider (1+ year old)

---

## **My Actual Recommendation**

**Don't subscribe to MediaCrawlers yet.**

**Do this instead:**
1. Check **SocialScrapper's rating/reviews** (I couldn't load it earlier)
2. Search RapidAPI for TikTok APIs sorted by **"Most Popular"** or **"Highest Rated"**
3. Pick one with:
   - Rating ≥4.0
   - 5k+ subscribers
   - At least 6 months old
4. Compare pricing to these two APIs

**If all TikTok APIs have shit ratings:**
- That means TikTok is actively blocking scrapers
- You'll need to rotate APIs frequently
- Or use the hybrid method (free scraping + occasional API calls)

---

## **Bottom Line**

**No, I'm not sure MediaCrawlers is good.**  
**1.9/5 rating = it's probably shit.**

Check other TikTok APIs on RapidAPI with better ratings before committing.
