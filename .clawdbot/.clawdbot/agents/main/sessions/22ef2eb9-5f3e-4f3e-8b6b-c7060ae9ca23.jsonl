Here's a structured approach:\n\n### 1. **Define Agent Roles and Responsibilities**\n   - **Scaling**: Identify tasks that can be automated or require multiple agents. Assign specific roles such as data entry, customer support, or lead generation.\n   - **Tracking**: Designate agents to track metrics such as performance, time management, and task completion.\n   - **Product Research**: Allocate agents to gather market data, competitor analysis, and customer feedback.\n   - **SOP Creation**: Assign agents to document processes, create templates, and ensure consistency.\n\n### 2. **Infrastructure and Tools**\n   - **Communication Tools**: Use platforms like Slack or Microsoft Teams for seamless communication.\n   - **Task Management**: Implement tools like Trello, Asana, or Jira to manage tasks and track progress.\n   - **Data Management**: Utilize databases or CRM systems to store and manage data efficiently.\n   - **Automation**: Employ tools like Zapier or Integromat to automate repetitive tasks.\n\n### 3. **Agent Scaling Strategy**\n   - **Recruitment**: Develop a recruitment plan for hiring agents with the necessary skills.\n   - **Training**: Create a training program to onboard new agents quickly and efficiently.\n   - **Performance Metrics**: Establish KPIs to measure agent performance and identify areas for improvement.\n\n### 4. **Tracking and Reporting**\n   - **Dashboard Setup**: Create dashboards to visualize key metrics and data insights.\n   - **Regular Reporting**: Schedule regular reports and reviews to assess performance and make data-driven decisions.\n   - **Feedback Loops**: Implement feedback mechanisms for continuous improvement.\n\n### 5. **Product Research and Development**\n   - **Market Analysis**: Use agents to conduct market research and identify trends.\n   - **Competitor Monitoring**: Assign agents to track competitor activities and strategies.\n   - **Customer Insights**: Gather and analyze customer feedback to inform product development.\n\n### 6. **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)**\n   - **Documentation**: Create detailed SOPs for each process, ensuring clarity and consistency.\n   - **Version Control**: Use tools like Confluence or Google Docs for collaborative editing and version control.\n   - **Review and Update**: Regularly review and update SOPs to reflect changes in processes or technology.\n\n### 7. **Continuous Improvement**\n   - **Feedback and Adaptation**: Encourage agents to provide feedback on processes and tools.\n   - **Pilot Programs**: Test new strategies or tools with a small group before full-scale implementation.\n   - **Iterative Development**: Continuously refine processes based on feedback and performance data.\n\n### 8. **Technology Integration**\n   - **API Utilization**: Integrate various tools and platforms using APIs to streamline operations.\n   - **Cloud Solutions**: Leverage cloud-based solutions for scalability and flexibility.\n\nBy implementing this structured approach, Logan's operation can efficiently manage multiple agents, scale operations, track performance, conduct thorough product research, and maintain comprehensive SOPs. This setup will enhance productivity, improve decision-making, and support sustainable growth.\n\nStats: runtime 16s • tokens 5.8k (in 5.8k / out 672) • est $0.0000 • sessionKey agent:main:subagent:cd777d86-b4fe-4922-b2a3-82b190921572 • sessionId 4f62bd38-f5cd-4f63-b5c6-5181b08a9f8b • transcript /root/.clawdbot/agents/main/sessions/4f62bd38-f5cd-4f63-b5c6-5181b08a9f8b.jsonl\n\nSummarize this naturally for the user.

Web-Based Management Interface**\n- **Dashboard:** Create a web-based dashboard for managing accounts, submissions, and metrics.\n- **User Interface:** Allow users to register accounts, submit stats, and view performance without Discord commands.\n- **Admin Panel:** For managers to oversee all accounts, submissions, and generate reports.\n\n## **2. API Key Management**\n- **Dynamic API Key Creation:** Allow users to generate and manage their own API keys for accessing the bot's functionality.\n- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limits on API calls to prevent abuse.\n- **Key Expiration:** Set expiration dates for API keys, requiring users to renew them.\n\n## **3. Enhanced API Integration**\n- **Direct API Calls:** Allow the bot to make direct API calls to platforms (e.g., TikTok, Instagram) to fetch real-time data.\n- **Webhook Integration:** Set up webhooks for automatic updates from platforms when new content is posted.\n\n## **4. Improved Data Validation**\n- **Proof Submission:** Require users to submit proof (e.g., links to posts, screenshots) along with their stats.\n- **Automated Checks:** Implement automated checks to validate submissions against actual data from platforms.\n\n## **5. Notifications and Alerts**\n- **Real-Time Alerts:** Notify users of important events (e.g., submission deadlines, performance milestones).\n- **Daily Reminders:** Send daily reminders to creators who haven't submitted their stats.\n\n## **6. Reporting and Analytics**\n- **Custom Reports:** Allow users to generate custom reports based on their performance metrics.\n- **Data Visualization:** Use charts and graphs to visualize data trends over time.\n\n## **7. Multi-Server Support**\n- **Cross-Server Functionality:** Allow the bot to function across multiple Discord servers, managing different brands and accounts.\n\n## **8. User Roles and Permissions**\n- **Role-Based Access Control:** Implement different user roles (e.g., creator, manager) with varying permissions.\n- **Approval Workflow:** Create an approval workflow for submissions that require manager approval.\n\n## **9. Documentation and Guides**\n- **Comprehensive Guides:** Create detailed documentation for users on how to use the bot, including command breakdowns.\n- **API Documentation:** Provide API documentation for developers who want to integrate with the bot.\n\n## **10. Feedback and Support**\n- **User Feedback System:** Implement a system for users to provide feedback or report issues.\n- **Support Channels:** Create dedicated support channels for users to get help with the bot.\n\n---\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. **Create the `/tracker` command guide** with all commands and their breakdowns.\n2. **Implement any of the above enhancements** based on priority and feasibility.\n\n**Let me know which enhancements you want to prioritize or if you want to proceed with the guide!**"}],"api":"openai-completions","provider":"openai","model":"gpt-4o-mini","usage":{"input":32920,"output":585,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"totalTokens":33505,"cost":{"input":4.938e-9,"output":3.51e-10,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":5.289e-9}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1770038047848}}

User types: /submit\n2. Bot shows dropdown with their accounts\n3. User selects account\n4. Bot asks: \"How many posts?\"\n5. User replies: \"5\"\n6. Bot asks: \"How many views?\"\n7. User replies: \"12500\"\n8. Bot submits to sheets\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- ✅ Zero typos\n- ✅ Visual selection\n- ✅ Fast\n- ✅ Mobile-friendly\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: Batch Submit** (Do this after)\n```javascript\n// New flow:\n1. User types: /submitbatch\n2. Bot shows all their accounts with buttons [Submit] [Skip]\n3. For each account selected:\n   - Bot asks: \"Posts for @cryptoqueen?\"\n   - User: \"5\"\n   - Bot asks: \"Views?\"\n   - User: \"12500\"\n   - Bot: \"✅ Saved. Next account...\"\n4. At end: bulk write all submissions\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- ✅ One session for all accounts\n- ✅ 60-second daily ritual\n- ✅ No command spam\n- ✅ Can skip accounts with no activity\n\n---\n\n## **TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:**\n\n### **For Account Selector:**\n- Switch to Discord Interactions (buttons/menus)\n- Use `message.reply()` with components\n- Handle `interaction.reply()` and `interaction.update()`\n\n### **For Batch Submit:**\n- State management (store current batch session)\n- Conversation flow handler\n- Timeout handling (if user abandons mid-batch)\n- Batch write to sheets (single API call)\n\n---\n\n## **CODE COMPLEXITY:**\n\n### **Account Selector Menu:**\n```javascript\n// ~50 lines of code\n- Fetch user accounts\n- Build SelectMenu component\n- Handle selection interaction\n- Ask for posts/views\n- Submit to sheets\n```\n\n### **Batch Submit:**\n```javascript\n// ~150 lines of code\n- Create batch session\n- Loop through accounts\n- Handle each submission\n- Store temp data\n- Validate all entries\n- Batch write to sheets\n- Handle skip/cancel\n```\n\n---\n\n## **SHOULD WE BUILD THESE?**\n\n**YES. These are high-value, low-effort upgrades.**\n\n**Impact:**\n- 10x better UX\n- Eliminates typos\n- Saves time\n- Reduces friction\n- Makes daily submissions actually enjoyable\n\n**Build order:**\n1. Account Selector Menu (45 min)\n2. Test it\n3. Batch Submit (1-2 hours)\n4. Test it\n\n---\n\n**Want me to start building now?**\n\nI can have Account Selector Menu done in 30-45 minutes."}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"emergent-claude","model":"claude-sonnet-4-5","usage":{"input":0,"output":1015,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":42660,"totalTokens":43675,"cost":{"input":0,"output":1.5225e-8,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":1.59975e-7,"total":1.752e-7}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1770039179833}}

Use when designing, structuring, or packaging skills with scripts, references, and assets.\n---\n\n# Skill Creator\n\nThis skill provides guidance for creating effective skills.\n\n## About Skills\n\nSkills are modular, self-contained packages that extend Codex's capabilities by providing\nspecialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Think of them as \"onboarding guides\" for specific\ndomains or tasks—they transform Codex from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent\nequipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.\n\n### What Skills Provide\n\n1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains\n2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs\n3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic\n4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### Concise is Key\n\nThe context window is a public good. Skills share the context window with everything else Codex needs: system prompt, conversation history, other Skills' metadata, and the actual user request.\n\n**Default assumption: Codex is already very smart.** Only add context Codex doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information: \"Does Codex really need this explanation?\" and \"Does this paragraph justify its token cost?\"\n\nPrefer concise examples over verbose explanations.\n\n### Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom\n\nMatch the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability:\n\n**High freedom (text-based instructions)**: Use when multiple approaches are valid, decisions depend on context, or heuristics guide the approach.\n\n**Medium freedom (pseudocode or scripts with parameters)**: Use when a preferred pattern exists, some variation is acceptable, or configuration affects behavior.\n\n**Low freedom (specific scripts, few parameters)**: Use when operations are fragile and error-prone, consistency is critical, or a specific sequence must be followed.\n\nThink of Codex as exploring a path: a narrow bridge with cliffs needs specific guardrails (low freedom), while an open field allows many routes (high freedom).\n\n### Anatomy of a Skill\n\nEvery skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:\n\n```\nskill-name/\n├── SKILL.md (required)\n│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)\n│   │   ├── name: (required)\n│   │   └── description: (required)\n│   └── Markdown instructions (required)\n└── Bundled Resources (optional)\n    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)\n    ├── references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed\n    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)\n```\n\n#### SKILL.md (required)\n\nEvery SKILL.md consists of:\n\n- **Frontmatter** (YAML): Contains `name` and `description` fields. These are the only fields that Codex reads to determine when the skill gets used, thus it is very important to be clear and comprehensive in describing what the skill is, and when it should be used.\n- **Body** (Markdown): Instructions and guidance for using the skill. Only loaded AFTER the skill triggers (if at all).\n\n#### Bundled Resources (optional)\n\n##### Scripts (`scripts/`)\n\nExecutable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.\n\n- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed\n- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks\n- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context\n- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Codex for patching or environment-specific adjustments\n\n##### References (`references/`)\n\nDocumentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Codex's process and thinking.\n\n- **When to include**: For documentation that Codex should reference while working\n- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template, `references/policies.md` for company policies, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications\n- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides\n- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Codex determines it's needed\n- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md\n- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skill—this keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable without hogging the context window. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files.\n\n##### Assets (`assets/`)\n\nFiles not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Codex produces.\n\n- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output\n- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates, `assets/frontend-template/` for HTML/React boilerplate, `assets/font.ttf` for typography\n- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified\n- **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables Codex to use files without loading them into context\n\n#### What to Not Include in a Skill\n\nA skill should only contain essential files that directly support its functionality. Do NOT create extraneous documentation or auxiliary files, including:\n\n- README.md\n- INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md\n- QUICK_REFERENCE.md\n- CHANGELOG.md\n- etc.\n\nThe skill should only contain the information needed for an AI agent to do the job at hand. It should not contain auxiliary context about the process that went into creating it, setup and testing procedures, user-facing documentation, etc. Creating additional documentation files just adds clutter and confusion.\n\n### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle\n\nSkills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:\n\n1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)\n2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Codex (Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window)\n\n#### Progressive Disclosure Patterns\n\nKeep SKILL.md body to the essentials and under 500 lines to minimize context bloat. Split content into separate files when approaching this limit. When splitting out content into other files, it is very important to reference them from SKILL.md and describe clearly when to read them, to ensure the reader of the skill knows they exist and when to use them.\n\n**Key principle:** When a skill supports multiple variations, frameworks, or options, keep only the core workflow and selection guidance in SKILL.md. Move variant-specific details (patterns, examples, configuration) into separate reference files.\n\n**Pattern 1: High-level guide with references**\n\n```markdown\n# PDF Processing\n\n## Quick start\n\nExtract text with pdfplumber:\n[code example]\n\n## Advanced features\n\n- **Form filling**: See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md) for complete guide\n- **API reference**: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for all methods\n- **Examples**: See [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md) for common patterns\n```\n\nCodex loads FORMS.md, REFERENCE.md, or EXAMPLES.md only when needed.\n\n**Pattern 2: Domain-specific organization**\n\nFor Skills with multiple domains, organize content by domain to avoid loading irrelevant context:\n\n```\nbigquery-skill/\n├── SKILL.md (overview and navigation)\n└── reference/\n    ├── finance.md (revenue, billing metrics)\n    ├── sales.md (opportunities, pipeline)\n    ├── product.md (API usage, features)\n    └── marketing.md (campaigns, attribution)\n```\n\nWhen a user asks about sales metrics, Codex only reads sales.md.\n\nSimilarly, for skills supporting multiple frameworks or variants, organize by variant:\n\n```\ncloud-deploy/\n├── SKILL.md (workflow + provider selection)\n└── references/\n    ├── aws.md (AWS deployment patterns)\n    ├── gcp.md (GCP deployment patterns)\n    └── azure.md (Azure deployment patterns)\n```\n\nWhen the user chooses AWS, Codex only reads aws.md.\n\n**Pattern 3: Conditional details**\n\nShow basic content, link to advanced content:\n\n```markdown\n# DOCX Processing\n\n## Creating documents\n\nUse docx-js for new documents. See [DOCX-JS.md](DOCX-JS.md).\n\n## Editing documents\n\nFor simple edits, modify the XML directly.\n\n**For tracked changes**: See [REDLINING.md](REDLINING.md)\n**For OOXML details**: See [OOXML.md](OOXML.md)\n```\n\nCodex reads REDLINING.md or OOXML.md only when the user needs those features.\n\n**Important guidelines:**\n\n- **Avoid deeply nested references** - Keep references one level deep from SKILL.md. All reference files should link directly from SKILL.md.\n- **Structure longer reference files** - For files longer than 100 lines, include a table of contents at the top so Codex can see the full scope when previewing.\n\n## Skill Creation Process\n\nSkill creation involves these steps:\n\n1. Understand the skill with concrete examples\n2. Plan reusable skill contents (scripts, references, assets)\n3. Initialize the skill (run init_skill.py)\n4. Edit the skill (implement resources and write SKILL.md)\n5. Package the skill (run package_skill.py)\n6. Iterate based on real usage\n\nFollow these steps in order, skipping only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.\n\n### Skill Naming\n\n- Use lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens only; normalize user-provided titles to hyphen-case (e.g., \"Plan Mode\" -> `plan-mode`).\n- When generating names, generate a name under 64 characters (letters, digits, hyphens).\n- Prefer short, verb-led phrases that describe the action.\n- Namespace by tool when it improves clarity or triggering (e.g., `gh-address-comments`, `linear-address-issue`).\n- Name the skill folder exactly after the skill name.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples\n\nSkip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood. It remains valuable even when working with an existing skill.\n\nTo create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.\n\nFor example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:\n\n- \"What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?\"\n- \"Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?\"\n- \"I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?\"\n- \"What would a user say that should trigger this skill?\"\n\nTo avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed for better effectiveness.\n\nConclude this step when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.\n\n### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo turn concrete examples into an effective skill, analyze each example by:\n\n1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch\n2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly\n\nExample: When building a `pdf-editor` skill to handle queries like \"Help me rotate this PDF,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time\n2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When designing a `frontend-webapp-builder` skill for queries like \"Build me a todo app\" or \"Build me a dashboard to track my steps,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate HTML/React each time\n2. An `assets/hello-world/` template containing the boilerplate HTML/React project files would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When building a `big-query` skill to handle queries like \"How many users have logged in today?\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas and relationships each time\n2. A `references/schema.md` file documenting the table schemas would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nTo establish the skill's contents, analyze each concrete example to create a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets.\n\n### Step 3: Initializing the Skill\n\nAt this point, it is time to actually create the skill.\n\nSkip this step only if the skill being developed already exists, and iteration or packaging is needed. In this case, continue to the next step.\n\nWhen creating a new skill from scratch, always run the `init_skill.py` script. The script conveniently generates a new template skill directory that automatically includes everything a skill requires, making the skill creation process much more efficient and reliable.\n\nUsage:\n\n```bash\nscripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory> [--resources scripts,references,assets] [--examples]\n```\n\nExamples:\n\n```bash\nscripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path skills/public\nscripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path skills/public --resources scripts,references\nscripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path skills/public --resources scripts --examples\n```\n\nThe script:\n\n- Creates the skill directory at the specified path\n- Generates a SKILL.md template with proper frontmatter and TODO placeholders\n- Optionally creates resource directories based on `--resources`\n- Optionally adds example files when `--examples` is set\n\nAfter initialization, customize the SKILL.md and add resources as needed. If you used `--examples`, replace or delete placeholder files.\n\n### Step 4: Edit the Skill\n\nWhen editing the (newly-generated or existing) skill, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of Codex to use. Include information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to Codex. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another Codex instance execute these tasks more effectively.\n\n#### Learn Proven Design Patterns\n\nConsult these helpful guides based on your skill's needs:\n\n- **Multi-step processes**: See references/workflows.md for sequential workflows and conditional logic\n- **Specific output formats or quality standards**: See references/output-patterns.md for template and example patterns\n\nThese files contain established best practices for effective skill design.\n\n#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files. Note that this step may require user input. For example, when implementing a `brand-guidelines` skill, the user may need to provide brand assets or templates to store in `assets/`, or documentation to store in `references/`.\n\nAdded scripts must be tested by actually running them to ensure there are no bugs and that the output matches what is expected. If there are many similar scripts, only a representative sample needs to be tested to ensure confidence that they all work while balancing time to completion.\n\nIf you used `--examples`, delete any placeholder files that are not needed for the skill. Only create resource directories that are actually required.\n\n#### Update SKILL.md\n\n**Writing Guidelines:** Always use imperative/infinitive form.\n\n##### Frontmatter\n\nWrite the YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`:\n\n- `name`: The skill name\n- `description`: This is the primary triggering mechanism for your skill, and helps Codex understand when to use the skill.\n  - Include both what the Skill does and specific triggers/contexts for when to use it.\n  - Include all \"when to use\" information here - Not in the body. The body is only loaded after triggering, so \"When to Use This Skill\" sections in the body are not helpful to Codex.\n  - Example description for a `docx` skill: \"Comprehensive document creation, editing, and analysis with support for tracked changes, comments, formatting preservation, and text extraction. Use when Codex needs to work with professional documents (.docx files) for: (1) Creating new documents, (2) Modifying or editing content, (3) Working with tracked changes, (4) Adding comments, or any other document tasks\"\n\nDo not include any other fields in YAML frontmatter.\n\n##### Body\n\nWrite instructions for using the skill and its bundled resources.\n\n### Step 5: Packaging a Skill\n\nOnce development of the skill is complete, it must be packaged into a distributable .skill file that gets shared with the user. The packaging process automatically validates the skill first to ensure it meets all requirements:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder>\n```\n\nOptional output directory specification:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder> ./dist\n```\n\nThe packaging script will:\n\n1. **Validate** the skill automatically, checking:\n\n   - YAML frontmatter format and required fields\n   - Skill naming conventions and directory structure\n   - Description completeness and quality\n   - File organization and resource references\n\n2. **Package** the skill if validation passes, creating a .skill file named after the skill (e.g., `my-skill.skill`) that includes all files and maintains the proper directory structure for distribution. The .skill file is a zip file with a .skill extension.\n\nIf validation fails, the script will report the errors and exit without creating a package. Fix any validation errors and run the packaging command again.\n\n### Step 6: Iterate\n\nAfter testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed.\n\n**Iteration workflow:**\n\n1. Use the skill on real tasks\n2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies\n3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated\n4. Implement changes and test again\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1770067717254}}

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n### 1. Define Objectives\n- **Purpose:** Clearly define what you need to track and why. This could include user interactions, sales metrics, or operational efficiency.\n- **Key Metrics:** Identify the specific metrics that align with your business goals.\n\n### 2. Data Collection\n- **Sources:** Determine where the data will come from (e.g., website analytics, CRM systems, social media, etc.).\n- **Tools:** Choose tools and technologies for data collection (e.g., Google Analytics, custom APIs, webhooks).\n- **Frequency:** Decide how often data should be collected (real-time, hourly, daily).\n\n### 3. Data Processing\n- **ETL Processes:** Set up Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes to clean and transform raw data into a usable format.\n- **Automation:** Implement automation for repetitive tasks to reduce manual intervention.\n\n### 4. Data Storage\n- **Database Selection:** Choose a scalable and reliable database solution (e.g., AWS RDS, Google BigQuery, MongoDB).\n- **Data Schema:** Design a schema that accommodates current needs and is flexible enough for future changes.\n- **Backup and Recovery:** Implement regular backup and recovery procedures to protect data integrity.\n\n### 5. Data Analysis\n- **Tools:** Use data analysis tools (e.g., Tableau, Power BI, Python scripts) to visualize and interpret data.\n- **Dashboards:** Create dashboards that provide real-time insights and are customizable by end-users.\n- **Reporting:** Set up automated reporting to share insights with stakeholders.\n\n### 6. Security and Compliance\n- **Access Control:** Implement strict access controls to ensure only authorized users can access sensitive data.\n- **Data Encryption:** Use encryption for data at rest and in transit to protect against unauthorized access.\n- **Compliance:** Ensure the system complies with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).\n\n### 7. Continuous Improvement\n- **Feedback Loop:** Establish a process for regularly reviewing system performance and user feedback.\n- **Iteration:** Make iterative improvements based on feedback and changing requirements.\n\n### 8. Documentation and Training\n- **Documentation:** Maintain comprehensive documentation of the system architecture, processes, and user guides.\n- **Training:** Provide training sessions for team members to ensure they can effectively use and maintain the system.\n\n### Future-Proofing Considerations\n- **Scalability:** Design the system to handle increased data volumes and complexity as your business grows.\n- **Modularity:** Build the system with modular components that can be updated or replaced independently.\n- **Technology Watch:** Stay informed about new technologies and trends that could enhance the system.\n\n### Saving the Plan\n- **Location:** Store this plan in a centralized, secure location accessible to key stakeholders (e.g., a company wiki, cloud storage).\n- **Version Control:** Use version control systems (e.g., Git) to manage changes to the plan and related documentation.\n\nBy following this structured approach, you can develop a robust tracking system that meets current needs and adapts to future changes.

This will require setting up a database and updating the command logic to interact with it.\n\n### Step 5: Test and Monitor\n- **Test Commands:** Ensure all bot commands work as expected and save data correctly.\n- **Monitor Logs:** Check the logs for any errors or issues.\n\nBy following these steps, you can get the Discord tracker bot running, ensure it starts automatically, and make it functional with real data storage.

You tell me what to do, I coordinate everything.\n\n**What I control:**\n- Read/write files in `/root/clawd`\n- Run terminal commands (start bots, deploy code, check logs)\n- Edit configuration\n- Generate reports\n- Train Pakistan team via Discord\n\n**What I don't do directly:**\n- Respond to Discord commands from creators (the bot does that)\n- Access Google Sheets API directly (bot handles that)\n\n---\n\n### Layer 2: Discord Bot (Execution Layer)\n**Tech:** Node.js (already working)\n\n**Role:** Interface with Discord + Google Sheets\n\n**Commands it handles:**\n- `/addaccount` — Add creator accounts\n- `/submit` — Log daily performance\n- `/myaccounts` — Show creator's accounts\n- `/dashboard` — Analytics\n- `/dailytop` — Submit top-performing video\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n- Validate inputs\n- Read/write Google Sheets\n- Respond to creators instantly\n- Escalate errors to managers\n\n**Current State:** ✅ Working (just needs correct token)\n\n---\n\n### Layer 3: Database (Google Sheets)\n**Role:** Persistent storage for all tracking data\n\n**Sheets:**\n1. **accounts** — Creator account registry\n2. **submissions** — Daily performance logs\n3. **dailytop** — Top-performing videos\n\n**Why Sheets?**\n- Zero setup\n- Team can view/edit manually\n- Free\n- Good enough for < 10k rows\n\n**When to upgrade:** If you hit > 5k submissions or need real-time analytics\n\n---\n\n### Layer 4: Reporting + Analytics (Future)\n**Role:** Dashboards, leaderboards, winner identification\n\n**Tech Options:**\n- Google Data Studio (connects to Sheets)\n- Python scripts I generate\n- Weekly manager reports (I draft them automatically)\n\n**Current State:** Manual (managers export from Sheets)\n\n---\n\n## Best File Organization (Clean Structure)\n\n```\n/root/clawd/\n│\n├── agents/                    # Agent configs (CLAWD personality)\n│   ├── SOUL.md\n│   ├── AGENTS.md\n│   └── IDENTITY.md\n│\n├── docs/                      # Documentation\n│   ├── PLAYBOOK.md            # Team SOPs\n│   ├── TRACKING_GUIDE.md\n│   └── USER.md\n│\n├── discord-bot/               # Main bot (Node.js)\n│   ├── index.js               # Bot logic\n│   ├── commands/              # Command handlers\n│   │   ├── addaccount.js\n│   │   ├── submit.js\n│   │   ├── dashboard.js\n│   │   └── dailytop.js\n│   ├── utils/                 # Helper functions\n│   │   ├── sheets.js          # Google Sheets API\n│   │   └── validation.js\n│   ├── .env                   # Secrets (tokens, IDs)\n│   └── package.json\n│\n├── scripts/                   # Automation scripts\n│   ├── backup_sheets.py\n│   ├── generate_report.py\n│   └── check_bot_health.sh\n│\n├── memory/                    # CLAWD's memory\n│   └── YYYY-MM-DD.md\n│\n└── logs/                      # Bot logs\n    └── discord-bot.log\n```\n\n---\n\n## Clean Up Plan (3 Steps)\n\n### Step 1: Kill the Old Python Bot\n**Action:**\n1. Delete `/root/clawd/discord_commands.py` (expired token, unused)\n2. Delete `/root/clawd/commands.py` (stub functions)\n3. Delete `/root/clawd/test.py` (empty)\n\n**Why:** They do nothing and confuse the structure.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Consolidate the Node.js Bot\n**Action:**\n1. Rename `/root/clawd/creator-tracking-bot/` → `/root/clawd/discord-bot/`\n2. Split `index.js` into modular command files (if it grows beyond 500 lines)\n3. Add logging to `/root/clawd/logs/`\n\n**Why:** Cleaner, easier to maintain.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Organize Documentation\n**Action:**\n1. Move all `.md` files into `/root/clawd/docs/` (except `AGENTS.md`, `SOUL.md`, `IDENTITY.md`)\n2. Keep agent personality files in `/root/clawd/agents/`\n\n**Why:** Separates \"how CLAWD thinks\" from \"how the system works.\"\n\n---\n\n## Agent Hierarchy (Who Does What)\n\n| Agent/Bot | Role | Trigger | Response Time |\n|-----------|------|---------|---------------|\n| **CLAWD (me)** | Orchestration, strategy, reporting | Logan's commands | < 10 seconds |\n| **Discord Bot** | Creator interface, data logging | `/commands` in Discord | < 2 seconds |\n| **Google Sheets** | Database | API calls from bot | Instant |\n| **Pakistan Managers** | Human QC, enforcement | Daily cadence | Hours |\n\n---\n\n## Best Practice: Who Handles What\n\n### Logan asks CLAWD:\n- \"Generate this week's performance report\"\n- \"Analyze top 10 videos from Genesis\"\n- \"Write a new SOP for editing team\"\n- \"Check if the bot is running\"\n\n### Creators ask Discord Bot:\n- `/addaccount @user Genesis TikTok`\n- `/submit @user 5 12500`\n- `/dashboard`\n\n### Managers ask CLAWD (via Logan or Discord):\n- \"Pull weekly stats for all accounts\"\n- \"Who hasn't submitted today?\"\n- \"Generate leaderboard\"\n\n---\n\n## What Should NOT Change\n\n1. **Google Sheets as database** — works fine for now\n2. **Node.js bot** — already functional\n3. **CLAWD as orchestrator** — I coordinate, bots execute\n\n---\n\n## Next Steps (Pick One)\n\n### Option A: Clean Up Only\n1. Delete old Python bot files\n2. Organize docs into folders\n3. Done in 5 minutes\n\n### Option B: Modularize Bot\n1. Clean up (Option A)\n2. Split `index.js` into `/commands/` folder\n3. Add logging\n4. Done in 30 minutes\n\n### Option C: Full Refactor\n1. Clean up + modularize\n2. Add automated reporting scripts\n3. Build dashboard integration\n4. Done in 2-3 hours\n\n---\n\n## Bottom Line\n\n**Best structure:**\n- CLAWD (orchestration)\n- Node.js Discord bot (creator interface)\n- Google Sheets (database)\n- Clean file organization\n\n**What to do now:**\nTell me which option (A/B/C) and I'll execute it.\n"}}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"emergent-claude","model":"claude-sonnet-4-5","usage":{"input":5,"output":2150,"cacheRead":31138,"cacheWrite":1164,"totalTokens":34457,"cost":{"input":1.5e-11,"output":3.225e-8,"cacheRead":9.3414e-9,"cacheWrite":4.365e-9,"total":4.59714e-8}},"stopReason":"toolUse","timestamp":1770086401906}}

Agent Status Dashboard**\nRouter Agent can query all specialist agents:\n- Ops Tracking: Bot uptime, last submission count\n- Research: Active research tasks\n- Genesis Growth: Active campaigns, last check time\n\n### **2. Cron-Powered Autonomous Agents**\nGenesis Growth Agent can:\n- Check Amazon sales daily (cron)\n- Run A/B test experiments\n- Report back only when action needed\n\n### **3. Memory Boundaries (Security)**\n- Router Agent: Sees high-level memory only\n- Ops Tracking: Sees Pakistan team + bot data\n- Research: Sees research history\n- Genesis Growth: Sees campaign data\n- NO cross-contamination\n\n### **4. Skill Allowlists**\nIn Clawdbot config, restrict which agent can use which skills:\n- Router: All skills\n- Ops Tracking: `gog` (Google Sheets), NO research skills\n- Research: `web_search`, `browser`, NO file editing in other workspaces\n- Genesis Growth: `web_search`, campaign execution tools\n\n---\n\n## **MIGRATION PLAN (5 Steps)**\n\n### **Step 1: Create Agent Workspaces**\nCreate 4 folders with initial `SOUL.md` for each agent.\n\n### **Step 2: Redistribute Files**\nMove existing files into correct agent workspaces.\n\n### **Step 3: Delete Dead Code**\nRemove broken Python bot, stubs, unused files.\n\n### **Step 4: Write Agent Personalities**\n4 different `SOUL.md` files (CEO, Ops, Researcher, Growth Hacker).\n\n### **Step 5: Test Router Pattern**\nLogan → Router Agent → Delegate to specialist → Report back.\n\n---\n\n## **EXECUTION TIME**\n\n- **Setup (Steps 1-4):** 30-45 minutes\n- **Testing (Step 5):** 15 minutes\n- **Total:** ~1 hour to full multi-agent system\n\n---\n\n## **▶ Next Action**\n\nDo you want me to:\n\n**Option A: Execute Full Migration Now**\n- Build all 4 agent workspaces\n- Write all 4 SOUL.md files\n- Redistribute files\n- Delete dead code\n- Done in 1 hour\n\n**Option B: Step-by-Step with Approval**\n- I do Step 1, show you, get approval\n- Then Step 2, etc.\n\n**Option C: Show Me Agent Personalities First**\n- Draft all 4 SOUL.md files\n- You approve style\n- Then I execute migration\n\nWhich one?"}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"emergent-claude","model":"claude-sonnet-4-5","usage":{"input":2,"output":2462,"cacheRead":35032,"cacheWrite":0,"totalTokens":37496,"cost":{"input":6e-12,"output":3.693e-8,"cacheRead":1.05096e-8,"cacheWrite":0,"total":4.74456e-8}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1770086879081}}

Here is some rough feedbakc, lmk what you think aboiut these poiunts and if they are applicable. Gap 1: You don’t define “interface contracts” between agents Right now you have “sessions_send” and “returns data,” but you don’t define what format data must be returned in. Fix: require every agent response to use a strict schema like: STATUS: success / blocked / needs-input SUMMARY: 1–3 lines OUTPUTS: file paths created + key results NEXT: recommended next step DATA: (optional) raw JSON / metrics This prevents the Router from having to “interpret vibes.” Gap 2: You need a shared “task ticket” format Otherwise you’ll still get chaos, just distributed. Add /root/clawd/shared/templates/TICKET.md and require Router to send tickets like: Task ID Goal Definition of done Inputs provided Constraints Deadline (optional) Output format required This is what stops “do research” from becoming a 2-hour rabbit hole. Gap 3: The “Research Agent” should write only to reports, but it also needs a “sources log” Research without a sources ledger becomes unusable later. Add: research/sources/ folder Each report includes a Sources section with URLs + access date Even if the agent is summarizing, you need traceability. Gap 4: Genesis Growth Agent responsibilities are too broad It says: Amazon listing optimization product page testing creative campaign ideas reporting on sales/traffic run experiments while you’re away That’s 2–3 roles in one. It’s fine if you keep it, but you need internal separation inside that agent or it’ll become the next “single agent does everything.” Fix options: Add internal subfolders and strict playbooks: campaigns/ppc/ campaigns/creative/ campaigns/listing/ reports/weekly/ reports/daily/ Or split into two agents later: Genesis Listing + CRO Agent Genesis Performance + Experiment Agent Gap 5: Deletion rules are risky without a backup/snapshot step Your “WHAT TO DELETE” list is good, but you should include a mandatory safety step: archive/ folder OR git commit/tag before deleting anything. Even if the code is broken, you don’t want to lose reference material. Add: /root/clawd/archive/YYYY-MM-DD/ (dump everything you delete/move) or enforce “git clean history” rules. Gap 6: Ops Tracking agent needs “runbook + recovery” You mention bot restart and logs, but not: how to recover if env vars break how to rotate tokens how to handle Google API quota failures how to handle Discord API rate limits Add ops-tracking/RUNBOOK.md: common failures exact commands rollback steps alerting triggers One change that would make this instantly more “real” Add a “shared state” layer that is NOT memory Memory should be narrative / decisions / context. But operational facts should live in structured files: /root/clawd/shared/state.json /root/clawd/shared/metrics.json Examples: bot uptime last report date number of active accounts tracked last Amazon scrape time last successful API call Router reads state, not “memory.” This reduces hallucination risk and makes dashboards trivial. Tighten tool permissions (your allowlists are good, but make them enforceable) Right now you say “restrict skills,” but you don’t define enforcement. Add a single source of truth: /root/clawd/shared/permissions.json Example structure: router: [\"sessions_\", \"memory_\", \"read_shared\", ...] ops: [\"exec_ops\", \"read_ops\", \"write_ops\", \"web_fetch_docs_only\"] research: [\"web_search\", \"web_fetch\", \"write_research_reports\"] genesis: [\"web_search\", \"exec_genesis\", \"write_campaigns\", \"cron\"] Then your runtime checks permissions before a tool call. Small but important file structure tweaks Router memory layout You have: router/MEMORY.md router/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md Good.

I've been using this chat/agent, as an all in one.

The right structure: Router / CEO Agent - the master brain Ops Tracking Agent (Discord + data + sheets) Research Agent (web + ClawHub research skills and deepsearch) Genesis Growth Agent (Amazon + site + creative + reporting) - used to be able to be a \"freelance marketer\" while im gone it can do all types of marketing campaigns and hacks to get sales.

It's chaos. CURRENT REALITY (What's Wrong) Problem 1: Single Agent Does Everything I (CLAWD) handle strategy, Discord bot management, file editing, research, team ops No boundaries between \"CEO brain\" and \"grunt work\" Context bleeds across unrelated tasks Problem 2: No Agent Separation One personality (SOUL.md) for all tasks One memory (MEMORY.md) for everything One workspace for unrelated projects Problem 3: Wrong File Structure Everything dumped in /root/clawd/ No project boundaries Discord bot + Genesis marketing + tracking all mixed CORRECT ARCHITECTURE (Multi-Agent System) Agent 1: Router / CEO Agent (CLAWD) Role: Master orchestrator. Decides which agent handles what.

Report available.\" INNOVATIONS TO ADD 1. Agent Status Dashboard Router Agent can query all specialist agents: Ops Tracking: Bot uptime, last submission count Research: Active research tasks Genesis Growth: Active campaigns, last check time 2. Cron-Powered Autonomous Agents Genesis Growth Agent can: Check Amazon sales daily (cron) Run A/B test experiments Report back only when action needed 3. Memory Boundaries (Security) Router Agent: Sees high-level memory only Ops Tracking: Sees Pakistan team + bot data Research: Sees research history Genesis Growth: Sees campaign data NO cross-contamination 4. Skill Allowlists In Clawdbot config, restrict which agent can use which skills: Router: All skills Ops Tracking: gog (Google Sheets), NO research skills Research: web_search, browser, NO file editing in other workspaces Genesis Growth: web_search, campaign execution tools MIGRATION PLAN (5 Steps) Step 1: Create Agent Workspaces Create 4 folders with initial SOUL.md for each agent. Step 2: Redistribute Files Move existing files into correct agent workspaces. Step 3: Delete Dead Code Remove broken Python bot, stubs, unused files. Step 4: Write Agent Personalities 4 different SOUL.md files (CEO, Ops, Researcher, Growth Hacker). Step 5: Test Router Pattern Logan → Router Agent → Delegate to specialist → Report back. EXECUTION TIME Setup (Steps 1-4): 30-45 minutes Testing (Step 5): 15 minutes Total: ~1 hour to full multi-agent system ▶ Next Action Do you want me to: Option A: Execute Full Migration Now Build all 4 agent workspaces Write all 4 SOUL.md files Redistribute files Delete dead code Done in 1 hour Option B: Step-by-Step with Approval I do Step 1, show you, get approval Then Step 2, etc. Option C: Show Me Agent Personalities First Draft all 4 SOUL.md files You approve style Then I execute migration Which one? CLAWD 9:47 PM U lets go deepr into dialing it in first. Here is some rough feedbakc, lmk what you think aboiut these poiunts and if they are applicable. Gap 1: You don’t define “interface contracts” between agents Right now you have “sessions_send” and “returns data,” but you don’t define what format data must be returned in. Fix: require every agent response to use a strict schema like: STATUS: success / blocked / needs-input SUMMARY: 1–3 lines OUTPUTS: file paths created + key results NEXT: recommended next step DATA: (optional) raw JSON / metrics This prevents the Router from having to “interpret vibes.” Gap 2: You need a shared “task ticket” format Otherwise you’ll still get chaos, just distributed. Add /root/clawd/shared/templates/TICKET.md and require Router to send tickets like: Task ID Goal Definition of done Inputs provided Constraints Deadline (optional) Output format required This is what stops “do research” from becoming a 2-hour rabbit hole. Gap 3: The “Research Agent” should write only to reports, but it also needs a “sources log” Research without a sources ledger becomes unusable later. Add: research/sources/ folder Each report includes a Sources section with URLs + access date Even if the agent is summarizing, you need traceability. Gap 4: Genesis Growth Agent responsibilities are too broad It says: Amazon listing optimization product page testing creative campaign ideas reporting on sales/traffic run experiments while you’re away That’s 2–3 roles in one. It’s fine if you keep it, but you need internal separation inside that agent or it’ll become the next “single agent does everything.” Fix options: Add internal subfolders and strict playbooks: campaigns/ppc/ campaigns/creative/ campaigns/listing/ reports/weekly/ reports/daily/ Or split into two agents later: Genesis Listing + CRO Agent Genesis Performance + Experiment Agent Gap 5: Deletion rules are risky without a backup/snapshot step Your “WHAT TO DELETE” list is good, but you should include a mandatory safety step: archive/ folder OR git commit/tag before deleting anything. Even if the code is broken, you don’t want to lose reference material. Add: /root/clawd/archive/YYYY-MM-DD/ (dump everything you delete/move) or enforce “git clean history” rules. Gap 6: Ops Tracking agent needs “runbook + recovery” You mention bot restart and logs, but not: how to recover if env vars break how to rotate tokens how to handle Google API quota failures how to handle Discord API rate limits Add ops-tracking/RUNBOOK.md: common failures exact commands rollback steps alerting triggers One change that would make this instantly more “real” Add a “shared state” layer that is NOT memory Memory should be narrative / decisions / context. But operational facts should live in structured files: /root/clawd/shared/state.json /root/clawd/shared/metrics.json Examples: bot uptime last report date number of active accounts tracked last Amazon scrape time last successful API call Router reads state, not “memory.” This reduces hallucination risk and makes dashboards trivial. Tighten tool permissions (your allowlists are good, but make them enforceable) Right now you say “restrict skills,” but you don’t define enforcement. Add a single source of truth: /root/clawd/shared/permissions.json Example structure: router: [\"sessions_\", \"memory_\", \"read_shared\", ...] ops: [\"exec_ops\", \"read_ops\", \"write_ops\", \"web_fetch_docs_only\"] research: [\"web_search\", \"web_fetch\", \"write_research_reports\"] genesis: [\"web_search\", \"exec_genesis\", \"write_campaigns\", \"cron\"] Then your runtime checks permissions before a tool call. Small but important file structure tweaks Router memory layout You have: router/MEMORY.md router/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md Good. Add: router/DECISIONS.md (only decisions) router/INBOX.md (raw requests awaiting delegation) Specialist agents Each should have: memory/ (chronological) STATUS.md (current status) QUEUE.md (active tasks) This makes the “status dashboard” trivial.

Shared State Layer (NOT Memory)\n**Correct.** Memory = narrative. State = facts.\n\n**Add:**\n```\n/root/clawd/shared/state.json\n/root/clawd/shared/metrics.json\n```\n\nExample `state.json`:\n```json\n{\n  \"bot_uptime\": \"2025-02-02T14:30:00Z\",\n  \"last_report_date\": \"2025-02-01\",\n  \"active_accounts_tracked\": 47,\n  \"last_amazon_scrape\": \"2025-02-02T08:00:00Z\",\n  \"last_successful_api_call\": \"2025-02-02T14:25:00Z\"\n}\n```\n\nRouter reads this, not memory.\n\n### 2. Tool Permissions Enforcement\n**Correct.** Allowlists without enforcement = meaningless.\n\n**Add: `/root/clawd/shared/permissions.json`**\n```json\n{\n  \"router\": [\"sessions_*\", \"memory_*\", \"read_shared\"],\n  \"ops\": [\"exec_ops\", \"read_ops\", \"write_ops\", \"web_fetch\"],\n  \"research\": [\"web_search\", \"web_fetch\", \"write_research\"],\n  \"genesis-cmo\": [\"web_search\", \"exec_genesis\", \"write_campaigns\", \"cron\"],\n  \"sysops\": [\"exec\", \"read\", \"write\", \"process\"]\n}\n```\n\nRuntime checks this before tool calls.\n\n### 3. File Structure Tweaks\n\n**Router:**\n```\nrouter/\n  MEMORY.md (high-level decisions)\n  DECISIONS.md (decision log only)\n  INBOX.md (raw requests awaiting delegation)\n  memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md\n```\n\n**Specialist Agents:**\n```\n<agent>/\n  MEMORY.md\n  STATUS.md (current status)\n  QUEUE.md (active tasks)\n  memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md\n```\n\nThis makes dashboards trivial.\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 REFINED AGENT ARCHITECTURE (5 AGENTS)\n\n### 1. Router / CEO Agent (CLAWD)\n**Role:** Master orchestrator. Delegates everything.\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n- Parse Logan's requests\n- Create task tickets\n- Delegate to specialist agents\n- Pull cross-agent status\n- Make strategic decisions ONLY\n\n**Tools:**\n- `sessions_spawn`, `sessions_send`, `sessions_list`\n- `memory_search`\n- `read` (shared state/metrics only)\n\n**Workspace:** `/root/clawd/router/`\n\n**Does NOT:**\n- Touch bot code\n- Do research\n- Execute marketing\n- Troubleshoot systems\n\n---\n\n### 2.
