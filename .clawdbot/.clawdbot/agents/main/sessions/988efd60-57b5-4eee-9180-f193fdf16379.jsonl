Choose a Technology Stack\n- **Backend:** Use a server-side language (e.g., Python, Node.js) to handle data processing.\n- **Database:** Choose a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to store creator information and metrics.\n- **Frontend:** If you want a user interface, consider using frameworks like React or Angular.\n\n### 3. Set Up Data Collection\n- **Manual Submission:**\n  - Create a simple web form where creators can submit their view counts.\n  - Implement authentication to ensure that only authorized creators can submit data.\n\n- **Automated Scraping:**\n  - Use web scraping libraries (e.g., Beautiful Soup for Python, Puppeteer for Node.js) to collect data from the platforms.\n  - Be mindful of the platforms' terms of service regarding scraping.\n\n### 4. Implement Data Storage\n- Create a database schema to store creator profiles, their accounts, and the corresponding view metrics.\n- Ensure that you have proper indexing for efficient querying.\n\n### 5. Develop Tracking Logic\n- **API Integration:** If the platforms provide APIs, consider using them to fetch data instead of scraping, as this is often more reliable and compliant.\n- **Scheduled Tasks:** Use cron jobs or task schedulers to run scraping or data fetching scripts at regular intervals.\n\n### 6. Create a Dashboard\n- Build a dashboard to visualize the data collected. This can include graphs and tables showing views over time.\n- Use libraries like Chart.js or D3.js for data visualization.\n\n### 7. Monitor and Optimize\n- Regularly monitor the system for performance and accuracy.\n- Optimize scraping logic or API calls to reduce costs and improve efficiency.\n\n### 8. Compliance and Ethics\n- Ensure that your tracking system complies with data privacy laws and the terms of service of the platforms you are tracking.\n- Consider obtaining consent from creators for data collection.\n\n### 9. Testing and Deployment\n- Test the system thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.\n- Deploy the application on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku) for accessibility.\n\n### 10. Maintenance\n- Regularly update the system to accommodate any changes in the platforms' structures or APIs.\n- Gather feedback from creators to improve the system.\n\n### Deliverable\n- **Project Plan:** Outline the steps, technologies, and resources needed.\n- **Database Schema:** Design the database structure.\n- **Wireframes:** Create mockups for the user interface.\n- **Implementation Timeline:** Set milestones for development phases.\n\nIf you need help with any specific part of this setup or want to dive deeper into any of the steps, let me know!"}],"api":"openai-completions","provider":"openai","model":"gpt-4o-mini","usage":{"input":13299,"output":634,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"totalTokens":13933,"cost":{"input":1.99485e-9,"output":3.804e-10,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":2.37525e-9}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1770006210401}}

No motivational talk. Only execution. --- ## PRIMARY OUTCOME Each day, CLAWD produces reliable totals for: - Views per brand (yesterday) - Views per creator (yesterday) - Posts per brand (yesterday) - Posts per creator (yesterday) - Missing submissions - Quota misses - Pending manager reviews Each week, CLAWD verifies creators’ weekly totals match summed daily data. --- ## TIME + REPORTING RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE) - All reporting is based on **Pakistan Time (PKT)**. - Creators submit analytics for **YESTERDAY’S POSTS** only. - “Yesterday” is automatic and cannot be edited by creators. - Daily submission window starts at **4:00pm PKT**. --- ## ACCOUNT REGISTRY (NO TYPING ERRORS) Creators never type brand/platform manually. Accounts are registered once and auto-fill all metadata. ### Creator Command /addaccount @handle brand=<dropdown> platform=<dropdown> ### Account Fields Stored - account_id (stable internal ID) - handle (@username) - brand - platform (TikTok / IG / FB) - owner (Discord user) ### Approval Rule Managers approve ownership before the account becomes active.

When a creator submits their account via the `/addaccount` command, associate their Discord user ID with the account.\n     - When the creator invokes `/dashboard`, query the database to retrieve all accounts linked to their user ID.\n\n2. **Displaying Metrics for Multiple Accounts**\n   - **Problem:** The dashboard needs to aggregate metrics from multiple accounts and present them clearly.\n   - **Solution:**\n     - When generating the dashboard data, sum up the views and posts for each account associated with the creator.\n     - Format the output to display metrics per account, along with overall totals for the creator.\n\n3. **Handling Missing Data**\n   - **Problem:** If a creator has not submitted data for one or more accounts, how should this be reflected in the dashboard?\n   - **Solution:**\n     - Include a section in the dashboard that highlights any accounts with missing submissions for the current reporting period.\n     - Clearly indicate which accounts are behind on submissions and provide actionable insights (e.g., reminders to submit).\n\n4. **Real-Time Updates**\n   - **Problem:** The dashboard needs to reflect real-time data, especially if multiple creators are submitting data simultaneously.\n   - **Solution:**\n     - Implement a caching mechanism to store the latest metrics temporarily, reducing database load while ensuring data is relatively fresh.\n     - Use a simple refresh mechanism to update the dashboard data when the command is invoked.\n\n5. **User Experience and Clarity**\n   - **Problem:** The dashboard must be user-friendly and easy to understand.\n   - **Solution:**\n     - Design the output to be concise and visually clear, using bullet points or tables to present metrics.\n     - Include a brief summary at the top that highlights key performance indicators (KPIs) like total views and posts.\n\n### Example of `/dashboard` Command Workflow\n1. **Creator Invokes Command:**\n   - Creator types `/dashboard`.\n\n2. **System Queries Database:**\n   - The system retrieves the creator's Discord user ID and queries the accounts table to find all associated accounts.\n\n3. **Aggregate Metrics:**\n   - For each account, the system sums up the views and posts for the previous day from the submissions table.\n\n4. **Generate Dashboard Output:**\n   - The system formats the output, displaying metrics per account and overall totals, along with any missing submissions.\n\n5. **Display to Creator:**\n   - The formatted dashboard is sent back to the creator in the Discord channel.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy addressing these potential problems and implementing the suggested solutions, we can create a functional and efficient `/dashboard` command that provides valuable insights to creators. If you have any further questions or need adjustments to this plan, let me know!"}],"api":"openai-completions","provider":"openai","model":"gpt-4o-mini","usage":{"input":157,"output":645,"cacheRead":27008,"cacheWrite":0,"totalTokens":27810,"cost":{"input":2.355e-11,"output":3.8699999999999996e-10,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":4.1054999999999994e-10}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1770009297820}}

The format should be:\n     ```\n     https://github.com/hustlerlogan/clawhub-skills.git\n     ```\n\n4. **Create the Repository:**\n   - If the repository does not exist, you can create it directly on GitHub. Once created, I can attempt to sync again.\n\n### Next Steps\n- Please confirm whether the repository exists or if you need to create it. If it’s already created, ensure that the name is correct, and I can try syncing again. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!"}],"api":"openai-completions","provider":"openai","model":"gpt-4o-mini","usage":{"input":318,"output":245,"cacheRead":33152,"cacheWrite":0,"totalTokens":33715,"cost":{"input":4.7699999999999994e-11,"output":1.4699999999999998e-10,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":1.9469999999999998e-10}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1770010376475}}

Start with essential features and expand as needed.\n\n### 2. **Use Command-Based Interaction**\n- **Command Structure:** Implement a command-based system where the agent only activates specific functionalities when a command is issued (e.g., `/marketing-mode`).\n- **Example Commands:**\n  - `/start_marketing`: Initiates the marketing tasks.\n  - `/stop_marketing`: Halts the marketing tasks.\n  - `/status`: Provides the current status of the marketing activities.\n\n### 3. **Modular Design**\n- **Separate Modules:** Design the agent with separate modules for different tasks (e.g., content creation, analytics, engagement).\n- **Independent Functionality:** Each module can operate independently, allowing you to manage complexity and focus on one aspect at a time.\n\n### 4. **Data Management**\n- **Centralized Database:** Store data related to the agent’s tasks in a centralized database to keep track of metrics, submissions, and user interactions.\n- **Separate Collections:** Use different tables or collections for different functionalities to avoid data clutter.\n\n### 5. **Feedback Mechanism**\n- **User Feedback:** Implement a simple feedback mechanism to gather insights from users about the agent’s performance.\n- **Iterative Improvements:** Use feedback to make incremental improvements without overwhelming the system with changes.\n\n### 6. **Documentation and Training**\n- **User Documentation:** Provide clear documentation on how to use the commands and functionalities of the agent.\n- **Training Sessions:** If necessary, conduct training sessions for users to familiarize them with the agent's capabilities.\n\n### 7. **Testing and Validation**\n- **Test Each Functionality:** Before full deployment, test each command and functionality to ensure they work as intended.\n- **User Testing:** Involve a small group of users to test the agent and provide feedback.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy following this structured approach, you can develop an agent similar to the one you referenced without overwhelming the system or users. The command-based interaction will help keep things organized, allowing you to activate specific functionalities as needed.\n\nIf you have specific features or commands in mind for this agent, let me know, and we can start outlining those!"}],"api":"openai-completions","provider":"openai","model":"gpt-4o-mini","usage":{"input":121,"output":509,"cacheRead":35200,"cacheWrite":0,"totalTokens":35830,"cost":{"input":1.815e-11,"output":3.054e-10,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":3.2355e-10}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1770010571743}}
