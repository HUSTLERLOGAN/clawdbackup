I've been using this chat/agent, as an all in one. Which simply doesnt work. 1) Stop using one agent profile for everything ClawdBot/OpenClaw supports multiple agents (not multiple chats) with different roles, tools, and memory boundaries. The right structure: Router / CEO Agent - the master brain Ops Tracking Agent (Discord + data + sheets) Research Agent (web + ClawHub research skills and deepsearch) Genesis Growth Agent (Amazon + site + creative + reporting) - used to be able to be a \"freelance marketer\" while im gone it can do all types of marketing campaigns and hacks to get sales. Each agent has: its own system prompt its own workspace files its own allowed skills/tools set That’s what prevents cross-contamination. GIVE ME a high level breakdown of everything we need to add structure wise, things we need to get rid of, innovations, etc. You 9:47 PM ⚡ ✅ ABSOLUTE TRUTH — You're Right, This Is Broken Using one agent for everything is like having one employee do CEO work, Discord moderation, research, and marketing simultaneously. It's chaos. CURRENT REALITY (What's Wrong) Problem 1: Single Agent Does Everything I (CLAWD) handle strategy, Discord bot management, file editing, research, team ops No boundaries between \"CEO brain\" and \"grunt work\" Context bleeds across unrelated tasks Problem 2: No Agent Separation One personality (SOUL.md) for all tasks One memory (MEMORY.md) for everything One workspace for unrelated projects Problem 3: Wrong File Structure Everything dumped in /root/clawd/ No project boundaries Discord bot + Genesis marketing + tracking all mixed CORRECT ARCHITECTURE (Multi-Agent System) Agent 1: Router / CEO Agent (CLAWD) Role: Master orchestrator. Decides which agent handles what. Responsibilities: Interpret Logan's requests Delegate to specialist agents Pull cross-agent reports Strategic decisions only Tools: sessions_spawn (create sub-agents) sessions_send (talk to other agents) sessions_list (check agent status) memory_search (high-level recall) Workspace: /root/clawd/router/ Files: SOUL.md — CEO persona (strategic, decisive, blunt) AGENTS.md — How to delegate MEMORY.md — High-level decisions only USER.md — Logan's profile What it does NOT do: Touch Discord bot code Run tracking commands Do research directly Execute marketing campaigns Agent 2: Ops Tracking Agent Role: Discord bot + creator tracking system operator Responsibilities: Maintain Discord bot code Google Sheets integration Creator account management Performance logging Generate weekly reports Tools: read, write, edit (bot code) exec (run/restart bot) web_fetch (check Google Sheets API docs) NO web search, NO marketing skills Workspace: /root/clawd/ops-tracking/ Files: SOUL.md — Ops persona (technical, detail-focused, robotic) AGENTS.md — Bot maintenance rules TOOLS.md — Google Sheets API details PLAYBOOK.md — Pakistan team SOPs discord-bot/ — All bot code here What it does NOT do: Make strategic decisions Research competitors Handle Genesis marketing Agent 3: Research Agent Role: Web research + ClawHub skill discovery Responsibilities: Deep research on topics Find competitors, trends, viral content Discover relevant ClawHub skills Summarize findings for CEO agent Tools: web_search web_fetch browser (if needed for complex scraping) NO file editing in other workspaces Workspace: /root/clawd/research/ Files: SOUL.md — Researcher persona (analytical, thorough) AGENTS.md — Research methodology MEMORY.md — Research history reports/ — Output folder for research briefs What it does NOT do: Execute marketing campaigns Modify bot code Make business decisions Agent 4: Genesis Growth Agent Role: Autonomous marketer for Genesis brand (Amazon + site + creative) Responsibilities: Amazon listing optimization Product page testing Creative campaign ideas Reporting on sales + traffic Run growth experiments while Logan's away Tools: web_search, web_fetch read, write (campaign docs) exec (run scripts if needed) cron (schedule automated checks) Workspace: /root/clawd/genesis-growth/ Files: SOUL.md — Growth hacker persona (aggressive, data-driven) AGENTS.md — Campaign playbooks MEMORY.md — Past campaigns, winners campaigns/ — Active campaign folders reports/ — Performance data What it does NOT do: Touch Discord bot Do general research (asks Research Agent) Make CEO-level decisions NEW FILE STRUCTURE (Clean Separation) /root/clawd/ │ ├── router/ # CEO Agent workspace │ ├── SOUL.md │ ├── AGENTS.md │ ├── USER.md │ ├── MEMORY.md │ └── memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md │ ├── ops-tracking/ # Ops Tracking Agent workspace │ ├── SOUL.md │ ├── AGENTS.md │ ├── TOOLS.md │ ├── PLAYBOOK.md # Pakistan team SOPs │ ├── discord-bot/ # Bot code │ │ ├── index.js │ │ ├── commands/ │ │ └── .env │ ├── logs/ │ └── memory/ │ ├── research/ # Research Agent workspace │ ├── SOUL.md │ ├── AGENTS.md │ ├── MEMORY.md │ ├── reports/ # Research outputs │ └── memory/ │ ├── genesis-growth/ # Genesis Growth Agent workspace │ ├── SOUL.md │ ├── AGENTS.md │ ├── MEMORY.md │ ├── campaigns/ # Active campaigns │ ├── reports/ # Performance reports │ └── memory/ │ └── shared/ # Shared resources ├── brands.json └── templates/ WHAT TO DELETE (Dead Weight) Immediate Removal: /root/clawd/discord_commands.py — Broken Python bot /root/clawd/commands.py — Stub functions /root/clawd/test.py — Empty /root/clawd/TRACKING_MASTER_GUIDE.md — Move to ops-tracking/ /root/clawd/PLAYBOOK.md — Move to ops-tracking/ Current flat structure .md files — Redistribute to agent folders HOW AGENTS COMMUNICATE (The Router Pattern) Example Flow: \"Generate weekly performance report\" Logan → Router Agent: \"Generate weekly report\" Router Agent → Ops Tracking Agent: sessions_send → \"Pull weekly metrics from Sheets\" Ops Tracking Agent → Router Agent: Returns data Router Agent → Logan: Formats + delivers report Example Flow: \"Research top TikTok creators in finance\" Logan → Router Agent: \"Research finance TikTok creators\" Router Agent → Research Agent: sessions_spawn → \"Deep research on finance TikTok creators\" Research Agent: Does research, writes report to research/reports/ Research Agent → Router Agent: \"Report complete: /root/clawd/research/reports/finance-creators-2026-02-02.md\" Router Agent → Logan: \"Research complete. Report available.\" INNOVATIONS TO ADD 1. Agent Status Dashboard Router Agent can query all specialist agents: Ops Tracking: Bot uptime, last submission count Research: Active research tasks Genesis Growth: Active campaigns, last check time 2. Cron-Powered Autonomous Agents Genesis Growth Agent can: Check Amazon sales daily (cron) Run A/B test experiments Report back only when action needed 3. Memory Boundaries (Security) Router Agent: Sees high-level memory only Ops Tracking: Sees Pakistan team + bot data Research: Sees research history Genesis Growth: Sees campaign data NO cross-contamination 4. Skill Allowlists In Clawdbot config, restrict which agent can use which skills: Router: All skills Ops Tracking: gog (Google Sheets), NO research skills Research: web_search, browser, NO file editing in other workspaces Genesis Growth: web_search, campaign execution tools MIGRATION PLAN (5 Steps) Step 1: Create Agent Workspaces Create 4 folders with initial SOUL.md for each agent. Step 2: Redistribute Files Move existing files into correct agent workspaces. Step 3: Delete Dead Code Remove broken Python bot, stubs, unused files. Step 4: Write Agent Personalities 4 different SOUL.md files (CEO, Ops, Researcher, Growth Hacker). Step 5: Test Router Pattern Logan → Router Agent → Delegate to specialist → Report back. EXECUTION TIME Setup (Steps 1-4): 30-45 minutes Testing (Step 5): 15 minutes Total: ~1 hour to full multi-agent system ▶ Next Action Do you want me to: Option A: Execute Full Migration Now Build all 4 agent workspaces Write all 4 SOUL.md files Redistribute files Delete dead code Done in 1 hour Option B: Step-by-Step with Approval I do Step 1, show you, get approval Then Step 2, etc. Option C: Show Me Agent Personalities First Draft all 4 SOUL.md files You approve style Then I execute migration Which one? CLAWD 9:47 PM U lets go deepr into dialing it in first. Here is some rough feedbakc, lmk what you think aboiut these poiunts and if they are applicable. Gap 1: You don’t define “interface contracts” between agents Right now you have “sessions_send” and “returns data,” but you don’t define what format data must be returned in. Fix: require every agent response to use a strict schema like: STATUS: success / blocked / needs-input SUMMARY: 1–3 lines OUTPUTS: file paths created + key results NEXT: recommended next step DATA: (optional) raw JSON / metrics This prevents the Router from having to “interpret vibes.” Gap 2: You need a shared “task ticket” format Otherwise you’ll still get chaos, just distributed. Add /root/clawd/shared/templates/TICKET.md and require Router to send tickets like: Task ID Goal Definition of done Inputs provided Constraints Deadline (optional) Output format required This is what stops “do research” from becoming a 2-hour rabbit hole. Gap 3: The “Research Agent” should write only to reports, but it also needs a “sources log” Research without a sources ledger becomes unusable later. Add: research/sources/ folder Each report includes a Sources section with URLs + access date Even if the agent is summarizing, you need traceability. Gap 4: Genesis Growth Agent responsibilities are too broad It says: Amazon listing optimization product page testing creative campaign ideas reporting on sales/traffic run experiments while you’re away That’s 2–3 roles in one. It’s fine if you keep it, but you need internal separation inside that agent or it’ll become the next “single agent does everything.” Fix options: Add internal subfolders and strict playbooks: campaigns/ppc/ campaigns/creative/ campaigns/listing/ reports/weekly/ reports/daily/ Or split into two agents later: Genesis Listing + CRO Agent Genesis Performance + Experiment Agent Gap 5: Deletion rules are risky without a backup/snapshot step Your “WHAT TO DELETE” list is good, but you should include a mandatory safety step: archive/ folder OR git commit/tag before deleting anything. Even if the code is broken, you don’t want to lose reference material. Add: /root/clawd/archive/YYYY-MM-DD/ (dump everything you delete/move) or enforce “git clean history” rules. Gap 6: Ops Tracking agent needs “runbook + recovery” You mention bot restart and logs, but not: how to recover if env vars break how to rotate tokens how to handle Google API quota failures how to handle Discord API rate limits Add ops-tracking/RUNBOOK.md: common failures exact commands rollback steps alerting triggers One change that would make this instantly more “real” Add a “shared state” layer that is NOT memory Memory should be narrative / decisions / context. But operational facts should live in structured files: /root/clawd/shared/state.json /root/clawd/shared/metrics.json Examples: bot uptime last report date number of active accounts tracked last Amazon scrape time last successful API call Router reads state, not “memory.” This reduces hallucination risk and makes dashboards trivial. Tighten tool permissions (your allowlists are good, but make them enforceable) Right now you say “restrict skills,” but you don’t define enforcement. Add a single source of truth: /root/clawd/shared/permissions.json Example structure: router: [\"sessions_\", \"memory_\", \"read_shared\", ...] ops: [\"exec_ops\", \"read_ops\", \"write_ops\", \"web_fetch_docs_only\"] research: [\"web_search\", \"web_fetch\", \"write_research_reports\"] genesis: [\"web_search\", \"exec_genesis\", \"write_campaigns\", \"cron\"] Then your runtime checks permissions before a tool call. Small but important file structure tweaks Router memory layout You have: router/MEMORY.md router/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md Good. Add: router/DECISIONS.md (only decisions) router/INBOX.md (raw requests awaiting delegation) Specialist agents Each should have: memory/ (chronological) STATUS.md (current status) QUEUE.md (active tasks) This makes the “status dashboard” trivial. ALSO lets go super deep into all the resources you need fromme. The main agents / workplaces will be the main ceo brain, ops tracking & management /everthing with the discord bot, Research & SOP - used both for product research, in depth persona research, and for creating high level brand SOPS, then Genesis CMO - this is a high level agent that can do all types of things relating to marketing that can be done in scale and while im asleep. organic hacking, threads, making x posts, etc. (maybe posts is too complex for now but lmk) now tell me how I would use applicable skills from clawhub and how those would work across the spaces You 9:57 PM ⚡ CLAWD 9:57 PM U ALSO I think we need another agent that is solely for troubleshooting, maintence, making sure everything is running (unless thats what the main brain is for\n[message_id: 3d29d475-74a2-47de-9f08-beba6fd0cf04]"}],"timestamp":1770089264131}}
